## About IdentityServer

This project is a fork of the deprecated [identityserver4](https://github.com/IdentityServer/IdentityServer4). 

Currently it is funcional in sync with identityserver4 but it is planned to stripe it down to following core features:

- application authentication flows
- federation of other identity providers

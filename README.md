## About IdentityServer

This project is a fork of the deprecated [identityserver4](https://github.com/IdentityServer/IdentityServer4). 

Currently the implementation is the same as in identityserver4, but it is planned to strip it down to the following core functions:

- client authentication flow
- federation of other identity providers

If you are looking for a full functional replacement of IdentityServer4 please have a look at it's successor [Duende IdentityServer](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver).
